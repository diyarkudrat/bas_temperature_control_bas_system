# Cursor Tabs Setup ‚Äî Application + Network Layers (BAS Project)

## üìò Overview

This guide explains how to set up **AI-assisted feature development tabs in Cursor** for the **Application and Network layers** of your Building Automation System (BAS) controller project. It defines the tabs, their models, usage rules, and example prompts. This whole setup is a fun experiment idea when developing with Cursor‚Äîadapt or simplify it to match your team‚Äôs style.

Note: In this guide, ‚Äútabs‚Äù refers to Cursor chat windows/threads.

## üß≠ What, Why, and How

### **What**

A structured, multi-tab AI workflow in Cursor that separates **design**, **critique**, **implementation planning**, **coding**, and **triage**.

### **Why**

* Keeps development **organized and efficient**.
* Reduces **token usage and context drift**.
* Enforces safety, non-blocking behavior, and reliability in the **Application + Network layers**.
* Simplifies handoffs between stages (Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Audit).

### **How (Simple Explanation)**

1. Each stage uses a **dedicated tab** pinned to a specific AI model.
2. Each tab has a **short rules message** to keep responses consistent.
3. You pass only a **small handoff block** (summary, decisions, risks, patch plan) between tabs.
4. The AI helps you refine design, plan code changes, generate patches, test, and audit safely.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About `.cursorrules`

**What it is**

-.cursorrules is a small, repo-local rules file (in the project root) that Cursor reads to steer AI responses for this project.

**Purpose**

- Keep outputs consistent, small, and deterministic across tabs
- Encode the 6‚Äëtab workflow, roles, models, and allowed formats
- Provide a shared handoff block and guardrails (e.g., no code in Design)

**How Cursor uses it**

- When you work in a tab or chat window, Cursor pairs your prompt with these rules to shape the answer: output size limits, table formats, and the exact handoff data to pass between tabs.

**Quick walkthrough of sections**

- **Refine Mode**: If a message starts with ‚ÄúREFINE:‚Äù or asks about the DDR, temporarily switch to conversational design clarification (no size limits), then return to the standard DDR format when asked.
- **Tab 1 ‚Äî Design (Grok‚Äë4)**: Produce a DDR table (‚â§8 rows). Row format: `ID | statement | rationale | status | invariant?`. Include ‚â§200‚Äëword summary and Top‚Äë5 risks. No implementation or code.
- **Tab 2 ‚Äî Critique (Grok‚Äë4 Fast Reasoning)**: Review only the DDR table and risks; output 5‚Äì12 concise bullets highlighting risks/blind spots. No re‚Äëdesigning.
- **Tab 3 ‚Äî Implementation Plan (Grok‚Äë4)**: Convert DDR into a Patch Plan table (‚â§12 rows): `file | op | functions/APIs | tests | perf/mem budget | risk`. No prose.
- **Tab 4 ‚Äî Implement (Grok Code Fast)**: Output unified diffs only, one per logical change, with brief explanation and a small test checklist. Don‚Äôt regenerate whole files; include line numbers.
- **Tab 5 ‚Äî Triage (Grok‚Äë4 Fast Non‚ÄëReasoning)**: Parse test/device logs into an actionable TODO/fixlist (‚â§10 items) plus a short root‚Äëcause summary.
- **Tab 6 ‚Äî Sweep (Grok‚Äë4)**: Audit only changed `application/`, `network/`, or `services/` files; return a brief summary and an issues table (file, line, type, severity).
- **Handoff Format**: A compact block passed between tabs: short summary, decisions table, Top‚Äë5 risks, and a Patch Plan excerpt.
- **Tab Workflow**: The standard path: Design ‚Üí Critique ‚Üí Impl Plan ‚Üí (Critique) ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Triage ‚Üí (Sweep).

## üß© Tabs and Models

| Tab Name                               | Model                     | Purpose                                                                           | Typical Output                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Design (Grok-4)**                    | grok-4                    | Create a concise **Design Decision Record (DDR)** with invariants and tradeoffs.  | 8-row decision table + 200w summary |
| **Critique (Grok-4 Fast Reasoning)**   | grok-4-fast-reasoning     | Challenge the DDR‚Äîfind blind spots, risks, or counterexamples.                    | 5‚Äì12 bullet critique list           |
| **Impl Plan (Grok-4)**                 | grok-4                    | Convert DDR into a structured **Patch Plan** (files, signatures, tests, budgets). | Table of ‚â§12 rows                   |
| **Implement (Grok Code Fast)**         | grok-code-fast-1          | Write or modify code via unified diffs from the Patch Plan.                       | Git-style patches + test checklist  |
| **Triage (Grok-4 Fast Non-Reasoning)** | grok-4-fast-non-reasoning | Parse test or runtime logs into concise TODO lists.                               | Fixlist ‚â§10 items                   |
| **Sweep (Grok-4)** *(optional)*        | grok-4                    | Audit changed App/Net files for regressions or blocking code.                     | Targeted report                     |

## üìã Tab Rules and Prompts

For exact per‚Äëtab rules, output budgets, and example prompt formats, see `.cursorrules` in the project root. That file is the canonical source; use the table above for quick reference.

## üîÅ Daily Flow Checklist

1. **Design ‚Üí** Draft DDR (Sonnet)
2. **Critique ‚Üí** Review DDR (Grok)
3. **Impl Plan ‚Üí** Build Patch Plan (Sonnet)
4. **Critique (optional) ‚Üí** Validate Patch Plan (Grok)

## üì¶ Handoff Block (copy between tabs)

```
[Summary ‚â§120w]
[Decisions ‚â§8 rows: ID | statement | rationale | status | invariant?]
[Top-5 Risks (one-liners)]
[Patch Plan excerpt ‚â§12 rows or 'pending']
```

## üí° Tips for Low Context & Small Diffs

* Always hand off **summaries**, not full docs.
* Keep **DDR and Patch Plan tables small**.
* For each change, create **one unified diff**.
* Scope audits/sweeps to **changed files only**.
* If responses grow long, remind the model: *"Keep context <400 tokens."*

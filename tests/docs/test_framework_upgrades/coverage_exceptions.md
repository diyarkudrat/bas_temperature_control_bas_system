# Coverage Exceptions Register

Phase R1 introduces a living register for any modules that legitimately fall below the
project-wide 90% coverage guardrail. Each entry must include an owner, rationale, and
explicit review cadence so we can demonstrate governance rigor to hiring stakeholders.

| Module / Path | Current Coverage | Exception Type | Owner | Rationale | Mitigation Plan | Next Review |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| _None (baseline)_ | n/a | n/a | n/a | Initial baseline established; no exceptions recorded yet. | Populate after first baseline run. | Phase R2 checkpoint |

## How to Update
- Add one row per module or logical grouping that remains below the target.
- Link to PRs or tickets tracking remediation work in the Rationale or Mitigation columns.
- Update `Next Review` whenever the exception is revisited so we maintain accountability.

> Note: Do **not** remove historical rows; instead, mark them as resolved with final coverage
> metrics to preserve the decision trail.

Use this table to track any modules that fall below the default 90% coverage baseline. Document why the exception exists, who owns the follow-up, the next review checkpoint, and the plan to close the gap.

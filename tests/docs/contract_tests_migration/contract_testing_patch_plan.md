# Contract Testing Migration Patch Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines the Patch Plan derived from the Design Decision Record (DDR) for migrating the BAS System Project's testing from legacy mocks to a contract-based approach. The plan focuses on concrete, actionable changes across files, including adding new components for protocols, validators, and centralized rules, as well as modifying existing tests and configurations. Each entry specifies the target file, operation (add/modify), key functions/APIs, associated tests, performance/memory budgets, and potential risks.

The plan ensures phased implementation with invariants like full mock sunset and contract enforcement, while optimizing for minimal overhead in a solo development workflow. **Progress: 18/18 tasks completed** - All contract testing migration tasks finished successfully.

## Implementation Notes

- **Phased Approach**: ✅ **Phase 1 (Foundation) Complete** - Core protocols, validators, and business rules implemented. ✅ **Phase 2 (Infrastructure) Complete** - Pytest hooks and CI integration finished. ✅ **Phase 3 (Migration) Complete** - All 11 test file migrations completed (audit, users, base, devices, models, service_factory, sessions, telemetry, auth_services, mocks, migration_guide, pytest_config). ⏳ **Phase 4 (Configuration) Pending** - Final configuration updates.
- **Testing Strategy**: All changes include unit and integration tests focused on contract compliance. Edge cases are documented but not exhaustively tested unless critical (e.g., auth).
- **Budgets**: Perf/mem estimates are conservative; monitor during implementation. Risks are mitigated by centralization (D7) and AI guidance (D8).
- **Next Steps**: ✅ **All Phase 3 migrations completed!** Contract testing migration is now fully implemented. Run comprehensive testing suite to validate all changes. Consider Phase 4 configuration updates for production deployment.

This plan aligns with the DDR invariants (e.g., full adoption, validation hooks) while keeping changes incremental and low-risk.

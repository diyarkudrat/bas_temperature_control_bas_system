# Contract Testing Design Decisions

## Introduction
This document captures the Design Decision Record (DDR) for migrating the BAS System Project's testing from legacy mocks to contract-based approaches. It prioritizes sustainability and reliability in a scalable, distributed backend, demonstrating thoughtful engineering for a solo showcase. Decisions emphasize preventing drift, enforcing core business rules (e.g., auth, telemetry), and accepting short-term costs for long-term maintainability.

## Summary
This DDR outlines a sustainability-focused migration to contract-based testing, sunsetting legacy mocks and adding runtime validations with centralized rules. Invariants (D1, D3, D4, D5, D7) ensure enforcement, while flexible elements (D2, D6, D8) allow optimization. Trade-offs include initial boilerplate for robust foundations that reduce rework and enable reliable demos. Short-term slowdowns are deliberate for enduring quality, aided by AI documentation.

## DDR Table

| ID | Statement (≤20 words) | Rationale (≤25 words) | Status | Invariant? (Y/N) |
|----|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------|------------------|
| D1 | Adopt fully contract-based testing with legacy mock sunset | Ensures complete consistency by phasing out uncontracted mocks for long-term reliability | Approved | Y |
| D2 | Combine Protocols with runtime validation for contracts | Enhances type safety while catching duck typing issues dynamically | Approved | N |
| D3 | Implement phased migration with manual progress checklists | Supports fast iteration in solo projects while tracking completeness manually | Approved | Y |
| D4 | Add local and CI/CD contract validation hooks | Prevents drift in development by enforcing checks pre-commit, accepting workflow trade-offs | Approved | Y |
| D5 | Focus contracts on core business rules with edge case docs | Captures essential behaviors while documenting edges for optional coverage | Approved | Y |
| D6 | Optimize contract mocks for minimal setup overhead | Preserves quick feedback while adding enforcement benefits | Approved | N |
| D7 | Centralize business rule validation in shared modules | Reduces duplication and ensures consistent evolution across implementations | Approved | Y |
| D8 | Document migration with AI implementation guidance | Provides adaptable best practices and detailed specs for AI-assisted layer additions | Approved | N |

## Explanation of Key Decisions
- **Invariants (Y)**: Core principles for reliability, e.g., D1 eliminates drift via full adoption; D4's hooks guard against regressions in distributed services.
- **Non-Invariants (N)**: Flexible for practicality, e.g., D2 balances static/dynamic checks; D6 keeps tests fast.
- **Trade-Offs**: Front-loaded effort (D3 checklists, D4 hooks) builds scalable maintenance, prioritizing quality over speed initially.

## Top-5 Risks and Mitigations
1. **Boilerplate from validation layers could strain solo upkeep**: Use AI tools (D8) and centralization (D7); focus on high-impact areas like auth first.
2. **Selective edge case docs might permit overlooked divergences**: Core contracts (D5) as primary; supplement with CI checks for key edges.
3. **Manual migration checklists could falter without automation aids**: Add simple scripts to D3 for better tracking in solo workflow.
4. **Enforced hooks may initially slow iterations**: Accept as sustainability trade-off (D4); optional in dev, strict in CI for demos.
5. **Evolving business rules might demand contract revisions**: D7 centralization ensures updates; version contracts to limit churn.

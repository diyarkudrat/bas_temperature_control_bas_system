# Introduction

A production-grade, distributed BAS platform combining a Python/Flask backend (server) and a Raspberry Pi Pico W client. The server provides authentication, REST APIs, real-time telemetry, dashboards, and alarm management; the Pico client handles sensors and relays with a minimal footprint.

### Highlights
- Enterprise-ready authentication and session management
- Real-time telemetry and dashboards
- Extensible architecture and clean layering
- Scales from single-zone to multi-device deployments

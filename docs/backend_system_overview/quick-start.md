# Quick Start

## Complete System Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./setup.sh
```
This command:
- Sets up server environment and dependencies
- Configures authentication defaults
- Detects your computer IP and updates Pico config
- Makes scripts executable

## Pico Deployment (Alternate)
```bash
./deploy   # Deploy to Pico
./monitor  # Watch it run
```

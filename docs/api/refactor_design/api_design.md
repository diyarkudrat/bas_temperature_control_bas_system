# API Refactor Design Decision Record

## Summary (212 words)
Fully refactor BAS backend APIs into a distributed, scalable structure for future endpoints, prioritizing high reliability (99.99% uptime), low latency (p99 &lt;50ms end-to-end), and cost efficiency. Employ route-service layers with async I/O, versioning/deprecation, Firestore optimization (consistency/transactions), distributed caching (Redis), and observability. Mitigate risks through comprehensive testing, breakers, budgets, and monitoring. Trade-offs: Complexity from distribution/resilience vs. simplicity; replication/APM adds costs (~$50/month baseline) but enables geo-scaling; breakers introduce minor overhead for fault isolation. Constraints: Preserve auth/telemetry; backward compatibility; scale from single- to multi-instance/region with &lt;50ms p99. Enables tenant-isolated APIs (e.g., device management) without cascades.

## Decisions
| ID | Statement (≤20w) | Rationale (≤25w) | Status | Invariant? |
|----|------------------|------------------|--------|------------|
| D1 | Modularize into route-service layers with DI | Enables scalability/testing; patterns mitigate complexity | Proposed | Y |
| D2 | Use async for I/O with dedicated pools/fallbacks | Improves latency; avoids contention via isolation/testing | Proposed | N |
| D3 | Centralized error handling with versioning/deprecation/breakers | Ensures reliability/compatibility; protects against cascades inter-service | Proposed | Y |
| D4 | Rate limiting with explicit budgets (p99 &lt;50ms) and APM | Maintains reliability; enforced via distributed observability/profiling | Proposed | N |
| D5 | Optimize Firestore with indexes/distributed caching (Redis) | Handles limits/consistency; prevents stampedes via TTL/backoff | Proposed | Y |
| D6 | Enforce tenant isolation with multi-region replication/preferences | Supports geo-scaling/low-latency; hybrid queries for local reads | Proposed | Y |
| D7 | Mandate contract/load/stress testing with flags | Validates scale; mitigates distributed failures | Proposed | N |
| D8 | Add distributed scaling (balancers, Redis sessions) | Enables horizontal growth; handles stateful auth/drift via migration | Proposed | N |
| D9 | Integrate monitoring with existing telemetry/APM | Detects regressions; ties to budgets for proactive reliability | Proposed | Y |
| D10 | Implement cost budgets for replication/caching | Controls escalation; monitors via cloud billing alerts | Proposed | N |

## Top-7 Risks (with Mitigations)
1. Scaling over-simplification/drift: Mitigated by Redis sessions, migration, sticky affinity.
2. API breaks/cascades: Addressed via versioning, deprecation, contract testing, flags, inter-service breakers.
3. Performance overhead/latency: Handled with profiling, explicit metrics, CI, APM for network tracing.
4. Firestore limits/staleness/costs: Optimized with indexes, transactions, replication, caching, budgeting, monitoring.
5. Pattern degradation: Enforced via CI, docs, reviews.
6. Monitoring gaps: Integrated with telemetry/APM for logged changes/alerts.
7. Cost escalation: Managed with budgets, alerts, usage optimization.

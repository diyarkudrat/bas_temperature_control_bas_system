# Existing Services Refactoring Design Decision Record

## Summary (185 words)
Design a prototype implementation of SSE and Firestore services aligned with the new API structure, focusing on distributed scalability, low-latency async operations, tenant isolation, and reliability for learning and showcasing backend skills. Prototype SSE with Redis for pub/sub fan-out, emphasizing multi-instance compatibility without migration concerns. Build Firestore services from scratch using repositories as injectable layers with DI, versioning, breakers, and budgets (p99 <50ms). Prioritize modern patterns like async I/O and observability over legacy preservation. Trade-offs: Potential over-engineering for prototype (e.g., full Redis integration) vs. educational value; Redis adds setup complexity but demonstrates real-world scaling. Constraints: Prototype assumes greenfield; ensure 99.99% simulated uptime via testing; target p99 <50ms with APM. Enables experimentation with route-service model, centralized errors, and optimized data access, serving as a portfolio piece for distributed systems expertise.

| D3 | Implement API versioning and deprecation in services | Prepares for iterative prototyping; showcases forward-compatible design | Proposed | Y |
| D4 | Add breakers and explicit budgets to service calls | Explores reliability patterns; enforces low-latency goals in prototype | Proposed | N |
| D5 | Use Redis caching for Firestore with TTL/backoff | Optimizes data access; demonstrates cache management techniques | Proposed | Y |
| D6 | Enforce tenant isolation across all service methods | Builds multi-tenant skills; prevents prototype data leaks | Proposed | Y |
| D7 | Include contract/load testing in service prototypes | Validates design; provides hands-on testing experience | Proposed | N |
| D8 | Use feature flags for experimental service features | Allows safe iteration; teaches controlled prototyping | Proposed | N |

## Multi-Phase Plan

1. Phase 1: Preparation - Set up development environment with Redis and Firestore emulators, refine DDR decisions.

2. Phase 2: Core Implementation - Prototype SSE service using async Redis pub/sub and build Firestore repositories with dependency injection.

3. Phase 3: Reliability Features - Integrate circuit breakers, performance budgets, API versioning, and Redis caching with TTL.

4. Phase 4: Security and Isolation - Implement tenant isolation across services and add necessary security checks.

5. Phase 5: Testing and Iteration - Conduct contract/load testing, apply feature flags, validate invariants, and optimize based on results.

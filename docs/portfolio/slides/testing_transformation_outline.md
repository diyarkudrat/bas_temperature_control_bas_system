# Testing Transformation Slide Outline

## Slide 1 — Mission & Context
- Modernise BAS API/Auth/Logging test stack to support stateless deployments and
  ≥90% coverage guardrails.
- Align testing roadmap with architecture (modular middleware), reliability
  (health probes, rate limits), and security (JWT validation, redaction).

## Slide 2 — Execution Highlights
- Phase R1–R3: Fixture split, deterministic factories, helper utilities.
- Phase R4: Component coverage expansions (API/Auth/Logging).
- Phase R5: CI matrix with fail-under enforcement + artifacts.
- Phase R6: Documentation, alignment checklist, portfolio collateral.

## Slide 3 — Metrics & Governance
- Coverage trajectory chart (baseline → ≥90%).
- Governance automation (matrix workflow, regression guard, weekly digest).
- Coverage exception policy (ADR + register updates).

## Slide 4 — Team Enablement
- Playbooks: API service testing, logging guide, health/observability.
- Knowledge-sharing sessions & mentorship outcomes.
- Alignment checklist to track roadmap compliance.

## Slide 5 — What’s Next
- Phase R7 candidates: chaos testing seams, mutation testing spike, expanded
  dashboards.
- Continuous improvement cadence (monthly digest review, quarterly portfolio
  refresh).
